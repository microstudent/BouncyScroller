# BouncyScroller for RecyclerView


----------


This is a FastScroller for RecyclerView which is similar to Samsung's **TouchWiz 6.0**'s FastScroller. However, because of my lack of coding, in some ways, it has a little bug for now.

This project reference to [danoz73/RecyclerViewFastScroller][1] In some parts, with some bug fixed, and new feature added.

still working, will be released soon~

TODO List：

1. SIMPLE 模式下拉到最底下会有一定的间隙，范围计算错误；(fixed)

2. 添加带INDICATOR的SIMPLE模式；

3. SIMPLE考虑添加一个范围示意View；

4. 添加注释，编写文档。

5. IndexBar的ALPHA IN/OUT动画有BUG，导致在模式切换时无法正确显示
