# BouncyScroller for RecyclerView


----------


This is a FastScrollerView which is similar to Samsung's **TouchWiz 6.0**'s FastScroller. However, because of my lack of coding, in some ways, it has a little bug for now.
this project reference to [danoz73/RecyclerViewFastScroller][1] In some parts, with some bug fixed, and new feature added.
